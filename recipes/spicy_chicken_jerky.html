    <h1>Spicy Chicken Jerky</h1>
    <img src="../resources/spicy_jerk_chicken.jpg" alt="Spicy Jerk Chicken">

    <p>Chicken jerky? Who knew? And who knew you could make jerky in an air fryer? Plan ahead for this spicy snack as the 
    <br>chicken needs time to marinate and air-fry.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (5 ounce) boneless chicken breasts, cut into strips</li>
            <li>½ cup mojo criollo marinade (such as Goya®)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>6 wooden skewers</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine chicken strips, marinade, and Cajun seasoning in a resealable 
                <br>plastic bag. Refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Measure skewers to fit across the air fryer basket, slightly overlapping 
                <br>the edge. Trim off excess length.</li>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 180 degrees F (80 degrees C) for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Thread chicken strips onto skewers, leaving room in between each 
                <br>strip, while the air fryer is preheating.</li>
            <li>Air fry for 1 hour 15 minutes. Adjust cooking time as most air fryers 
                <br>have a maximum setting of 30 minutes. Rearrange the skewers during 
                <br>the reset time.</li>
            <li>Increase temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and air fry for an 
                <br>additional 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove strips to a paper towel-lined storage container. Seal. Allow to 
                <br>rest overnight before serving.</li>
        </ol>
